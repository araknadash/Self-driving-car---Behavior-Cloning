# Self-driving-car---Behavior-Cloning



This repositry implements a Self drving model based on Behavior cloning, by taking known driving details of the user as input and predicts steering angle, throttle and car speed. 

The model is created using the Self-driving-car---Behavior-Cloning/Behavior_cloning.ipynb and stored as 'arc_model.h5'
Using the Self-driving-car---Behavior-Cloning/connect.py the model is tested using Udacity's Autonomous driving simulator.
The model is ran on both known and unknown maps and performs pretty well ! 

Check out its performance in never seen before course track:

Further Improvements: 
I drove only 4 times in the track in both forward and reverse gear, can take more input for better prediction, also throttle can be increased and decreased throughout the course depending on the track.
